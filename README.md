# django_test

This is a simplistic blog site built with Django, a popular Python web framework.

This serves as an introduction to databases and templating for me.

Functionality currently includes the following:
* User Registration
* User Login
* Post Creation
* Post Updating
* Post Deletion
* User Profiles
    * User Profile Images
    * User Profile Updates
* Home-page Pagination
